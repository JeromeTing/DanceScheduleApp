# Dance Studio Scheduling Application

## Aim
This application's aim to manage dance classes and students in a weekly schedule.
The application:
 - will schedule dance classes (add and remove) to a calendar 
 - provide information about the classes
 - allow the dance studio to register/remove students to those classes
  - provide a visualization of the dance schedule. 

This application will be used by the dance studio and its administration team.
## Motivation
As a dancer in Vancouver many small studios use posters to advertise their classes on social media. Dance class
schedules are difficult to find for smaller studios, and I wanted to create an application that can help these studios 
manage their classes. Instead of multiple spreadsheets, this application will be able to keep track of which students
take their classes. This is especially important during this global pandemic when contract tracing is essential.
